A few months ago, it was decided by the Mile Cross community network that it would be great to grow free fruit and veg for local people to help themselves to in various places around the area. This idea is based on the town of Todmorden where this is already happening with great success[ Incredible Edible Todmorden](https://www.incredible-edible-todmorden.co.uk/)


I realised that in order to get the ball rolling, this year, we needed to find a few places to give people the idea, and to show them how they could get involved.


Together with help from people who live and work in the community, we found a couple of discarded pallets from a local industrial estate (NB pallets safe to use, not infused with toxic chemicals will show the markings DB, KD, EPAL or HT). We also scrounged some other discarded wooden planks, used the left overs from a pond liner from which we had made a pond locally, and used drills, screws and nails provided by the community.


A small group of people from the community, connected to the Phoenix Centre, arranged a time to meet up to create a prototype pallet planter.


Luckily, we had Kieran, a very handy person who lives locally, with carpentry skills, to tell us what to do and we followed his instructions. Aaron, another volunteer from the community helped too and he had the best time! ‘I love helping’ he said and you could see that he had really enjoyed getting involved.


The plants (strawberries, tomatoes, herbs, lavender, sweet peas and other good pollinator plants) and the peat-free compost was paid for by the local city councillor from one of her funds.


The wooden sign – many of which we hope to put around the Mile Cross area, was from discarded wooden board and branded by the Phoenix Centre craft group.


The Phoenix Centre put this little story out on their Facebook page and we’ve already had lots of interest shown by the local community. 


I am going to do a regular session at the Phoenix Center once a month or more regularly where we create more of these planters and get more of the local community on board.


Eventually it would be great for the local community to swap seeds and start to grow their own produce and flowers for free.
