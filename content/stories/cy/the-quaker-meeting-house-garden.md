Helen Deehan a local community organiser said about the project in Norton. 
“The grounds were identified as a place where with a little love and attention this could be a place where local wildlife can prosper. Bees, butterflies, moths, 13 different species of birds, insects, dragonflies, ladybirds, bats, and hedgehogs have already been found to be in and around the grounds of the meeting house.”


“Plans are afoot to help transform the grounds to help wildlife to thrive and possibly support a small-scale food-growing area too.”


This is a community project and we will have days where local people can come along and help and be part of the transformation. We also hope to have 'wild' days once complete where you can come and wildlife watch and seed swap too! It will be a 'grow up' project, to ensure burial grounds are not disturbed but nature has a chance to flourish.”


“The project is a great opportunity for children from the area to learn more about how important nature is and what we can do in our own gardens or schools to help not hinder nature recovery. We would love to hear from anyone who might have ideas for this early stage of planning. Also from local businesses who might want to help sponsor and support the project.”


Setting: 
Norton North and South in the top 10-20% most deprived in the UK. 
Norton Quaker Meeting House is off The Green near the high street so is very accessible for those in Norton. 


Conflict:
Difficulties surrounding it being a burial ground, can’t dig, must be a grow up plan. 
All of the group are over 75 so wouldn’t be able to do this on their own as they wouldn’t be able to do any of the heavy lifting for the project. 


Resolution: 
Helen Deehan had already been working with the Quakers and had come up with a plan with them for the garden but they still needed help to put the plan in place. I put them in touch with a local youth group Bright Minds Big Futures (BMBF) who were keen to do more work on their local nature sites. Helen also set up a Facebook Group to get the local community involved in the work. With the help of Helen, the local community, and BMBF the space has been transformed into a space for wildlife with a new growing area that has just been added this month.  

I﻿n December 2022, we made a film about their plans and hopes - find it [here.](https://youtu.be/RwFBLlmjLeI)
