In 2019 we built three raised beds and a small, secondhand greenhouse, along the eastern wall of our house, each 8 x 4 ft and separated by a strip of gravel. We have always gardened organically.

Nature and growing is an annual miracle, a wonder and joy for us.

We are currently planning the layout for this year's rotation of vegetables, very roughly on a scrap of recycled paper. 

Although the area is very small, we always have enough to share with family and neighbours, make chutney and blackcurrant jam. 

Ideally, we should like another raised bed for a couple of gooseberry bushes and to give enough space for a dormant patch each year but there will always be the temptation to grow there too.
