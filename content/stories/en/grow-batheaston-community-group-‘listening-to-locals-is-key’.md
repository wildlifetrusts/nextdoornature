From humble beginnings handing out free seedlings during lockdown, [Grow Batheaston](https://www.growbatheaston.co.uk/) has developed into a thriving community group, creating communal green spaces, connecting communities and empowering local people to live better lives.  

### The mission 

Grow Batheaston works towards four aims to help improve the lives of residents and local wildlife. 

* Strengthen community  
* Create food security 
* Encourage biodiversity 
* Promote sustainable living 

### How it all started 

Grow Batheaston started out as an unincorporated association, giving out seedling boxes to people with little experience in growing. Now the project has developed into something bigger, the group is in the process of becoming a charity to help them achieve more.  

A core steering group of seven and a board of six trustees are at the helm, but at the heart of the decision-making process is the community.  

The group’s events and activities are chosen according to community needs and requests. They also draw on the skills available to them in their team and community to create some truly inspirational initiatives.  

They bring together residents, local businesses and councillors to strengthen local networks, boost the local economy and develop their capacity to take action.   

### What is Grow Batheaston doing now? 

It is incredible to see how far Grow Batheaston has come over the last few years. Their strong ties with local people, organisations and funders have made it possible to create inspiring events that get people out in nature, forming connections and taking pride in their local area.  

“We believe that doing these things will strengthen local connections and has the potential to raise the standard of living for us all and bring health and wealth to our community.” 

Here is just a snapshot of the group’s activities: 

* Community gardens and forest garden 
* Clubs for growers, beekeepers, wildlife enthusiasts 
* Sports like football and netball 
* Wellbeing activities like hypnotherapy and wild swimming 
* Affordable parent-toddler nature groups 
* Community markets and art trails 

While community-building is key, Grow Batheaston never loses sight of its environmental aims. The group's efforts make the area more wildlife-friendly while raising awareness of nature's importance.  

Projects focused on increasing biodiversity include: 

* Planting wildflower meadows 
* Adding 500 native trees and 50 fruit trees 
* Creating a forest garden teaching sustainable food growing 

### Keys to success 

Ali, a member of the organisation’s steering group, said that listening to the community's needs is central to their group’s success.  

By speaking to people from different backgrounds across the community, they learn what is valuable to people and create a wide programme of events so there is something for everyone. These inclusive activities have been critical for growing the organisation’s reach in their area.  

You can [hear Ali talk about Grow Batheaston's approach here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6uQAlm8O2w). 

The steering group have also developed their skills in communicating with influential people which has helped them build strong relationships with people at Bath & North East Somerset Council, the local parish council, business owners, local authorities and other stakeholders. 

Keeping up regular contact is a big part of this. If you want to learn more about speaking to people in authority, take a look at some of the Nextdoor Nature guides below.
