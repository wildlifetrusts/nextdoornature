Our small mid terraced garden was in need of a makeover, so we set about building our garden around [wildlife](https://nextdoornaturehub.org.uk/guides/the-importance-of-local-species), birds, climate change and what works in our soil and environment. We use no pesticides and grow organically. 

My husband has made some raised beds for our veg, we have planted fruit trees that work in our garden and we have planted plants that are teeming with wildlife and birds. We have two small ponds which have an assortment of critters in, including frogs and newts and it all works. There is enough food for all.

We have lost minimal plants, have life through all the seasons. We have produced enough fruit and veg for our family (bearing in mind that our garden is only 3 years old now). Hopefully, we will go from strength to strength. 

Going wild is not about leaving the garden to its own devices, but creating and managing a landscape that will support a wide range of life and that means, ponds, leaving leaves to mulch, growing what works with your soil, climate and aspect.
