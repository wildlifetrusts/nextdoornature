In Bemerton Heath, a new project is transforming unused grass and [green spaces ](https://nextdoornaturehub.org.uk/guides/taking-over-green-space-in-your-area)into vibrant community gardens. The first of these gardens came to life at Pinewood Way after volunteers spent months of hard work planning, fundraising and obtaining various permissions.  

### Bringing together residents, charities and businesses 

Bemerton residents developed the original garden plan and over the course of two days in January, a dedicated team of volunteers came together for the build.  

This included volunteers from Beautiful Bemerton and the Salisbury-based community food initiative, The F3 Project. The volunteers were assisted by project workers from various partners including the Wiltshire Council, Wiltshire Wildlife Trust and landscape management company, idverde.   

The group also called on the help of [businesses](https://nextdoornaturehub.org.uk/guides/businesses-how-they-can-help-you-and-how-you-can-help-them) to provide some of the materials. Travis Perkins donated the raised beds and sleepers, while cardboard, manure and [compost](https://nextdoornaturehub.org.uk/guides/how-to-make-your-own-compost) were gifted by Hills Recycling.  

### Bringing people closer

The garden is already being put to good use. In February, residents came together for a seed swap and planting event, where local children planted seeds in eco pots to take home. The seeds will soon be brought back to grow in the new garden beds. 

Some planted a random variety of seeds in the beds in a guerilla gardening style. These mixed beds are a great way to make gardening wildlife-friendly! The group also plans to garden in a no-dig style, a method that avoids disturbing the ground to promote a healthy ecosystem, boost soil health and hopefully generate a more productive harvest. 

The beds are accessible for wheelchair users and will be filled with organic fruits, vegetables and herbs chosen by the community. The hope is that this garden and the Pinewood trees space surrounding it will help the community learn self-sufficiency and the skills to grow healthy food, whether from this garden or at home.
