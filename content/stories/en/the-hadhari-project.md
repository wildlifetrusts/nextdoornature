In late 2022, Adam from Derbyshire Wildlife Trust began to work with the Hadhari Centre which offers food and companionship to the elders in Derby's West Indian community. The building is right in the middle of Derby, near a busy road, but it had some unused outside space and small gardens all around.

T﻿he residents who use the centre wanted to be able to sit outside and watch the birds and relax. But as the centre also runs a lunch club, the community decided they also wanted to grow some vegetables they could use in the kitchens. Many of the older folk remember how they used to grow fruit and vegetables.

T﻿hey asked Derbyshire Wildlife Trust for some advice how to make sure their gardens would be great for nature as well as people. Joyce, the centre manager, was keen to get it right.

Adam went along to listen to people and learn from them, before offering help and suggestions so they could turn their dreams into reality.

I﻿n December, we made a short film about the hopes and plans of the community, which is [here.](https://youtu.be/ewAT7tX0AM4)

This project is at the very beginning but soon we hope to have an update!
