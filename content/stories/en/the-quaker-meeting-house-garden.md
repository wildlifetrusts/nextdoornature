#﻿# A community garden in Teesside - with extra challenges!

N﻿orton, in Teesside, has some wide wealth inequalities. It's a beautiful area of the country, with warm and generous people. And the Quakers in Norton wanted to do something to help nature and also help with the growing cost of living.

T﻿hey asked local people, and Teesside Wildlife Trust, if they could help turn their vast unused space behind the Meeting House into a place where people could grow food, in a way that benefited nature too. 

T﻿here is one problem - due to it being a historical burial ground, no one can dig. So now they are planning to build raised beds and planters.

I﻿n December 2022, we made a film about their plans and hopes - find it [here.](https://youtu.be/RwFBLlmjLeI)
