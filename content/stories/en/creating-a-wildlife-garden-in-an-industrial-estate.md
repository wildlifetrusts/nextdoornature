An industrial estate might not be the first place you would expect to find a wildlife garden, but thanks to staff at [Jamie’s Computers](https://jamies.org.uk/), Mount Pleasant Industrial Estate in Southampton is starting to look a little bit wilder. 

### The context

Jamie’s Computers is a social enterprise that takes in, refurbishes and recycles IT equipment from around Hampshire. It was set up by the Society of St James, a charity that exists to tackle homelessness and “to help vulnerable people overcome challenges in their lives”.

Their offices are located in Bevois, a Southampton ward that is generally lacking in [green spaces](https://nextdoornaturehub.org.uk/guides/taking-over-green-space-in-your-area) and trees. The industrial estate can also be noisy, with a cement factory, railway line and construction site nearby. 

### Getting started

Two staff members, Wendy and Bashir, had noticed the lack of green spaces so led efforts to build a [planter ](https://nextdoornaturehub.org.uk/stories/how-school-pupils-brought-a-neglected-planter-back-to-life-1)at the front of the building. 

Wendy said: “A few years ago, it was just full of weeds. It looked really uninviting like this, so we decided to plant a little garden and it was really beautiful.”

Unfortunately, the garden was damaged by passers-by, but last year, the pair decided to start planting again, including lavender, creepers and a few little shrubs.

“This year everything just blossomed beautifully,” Wendy said. “The most beautiful lavender with a lot of bees and bumblebees. It was amazing to stand and watch.”

Bashir added: “It was a really good feeling when we came into work and saw everything flourish. It was an instant mood-lifter. There is a clear connection between nature and feeling good.”

### Growing the green space

Now, Jamie’s Computers is creating a similar green space at the back of the building. It was too expensive to remove all of the rubbish that had built up over the years so instead, the staff repurposed materials and containers to build the garden. 

The old containers have been transformed into huge planters which are already attracting insects like pill bugs, worms and spiders. 

Jamie’s Computer’s operations manager, Andrew said: “The backyard has always been a bit of a dump, unfortunately, and so we thought let’s finally get it done. We had lots of containers out there that we could use for flower beds, so we thought, why not?”

Jill Doubleday of [Hampshire & Isle of Wight Wildlife Trust](https://www.hiwwt.org.uk/), who supported the project said: “Andrew is really enthusiastic and clearly keen to provide his staff and volunteers with a lovely area to take a break in, as well as for wildlife.  He’s more than happy to roll up his sleeves and get involved."

There is still more work to be done. For now, the green areas are enjoyed by Jamie’s Computers staff and volunteers, and eventually, they would like to open up the space to the Society of St James’ service users. 

Jamie’s Computers isn’t the first green project on the industrial estate. Next to it is SCRATCH, another charity, which already has a garden with wildlife-friendly areas. 

As the estate is located right on the River Itchen, it can be seen by cyclists and pedestrians using the boardwalk and footpath alongside the river, mainly to commute, or to get to St Mary’s stadium, home of Southampton FC.
