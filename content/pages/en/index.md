## T﻿his website will help you to help nature in your neighbourhood.

Fancy making your community a little bit greener, and that little bit wilder? You're in the right place! We’re in a nature crisis. This means that without our help, we will lose more and more wildlife – animals, plants, birds and insects. So this website offers you advice on how to help!

If you are looking for practical tips about how you can help nature, you will find everything on The Wildlife Trusts website. [Go to this link to find out how to do things like build a birdbox, dig a pond, sow wildflowers and lots more.](https://www.wildlifetrusts.org/actions)

On this website, you will find ***[guides](https://nextdoornaturehub.org.uk/search#guides)*** and ***[stories](https://nextdoornaturehub.org.uk/search#stories).***

***[Guides](https://nextdoornaturehub.org.uk/search#guides)*** are full of simple, easy-to-understand information in words and videos to help you to take action for nature. These guides tell you how to start a group, how to find funding, everything you need to know about insurance, banks, and more! 

***[Stories](https://nextdoornaturehub.org.uk/search#stories)*** are where you can read all about what other people are doing where they live and work. They are full of ideas to show you how everyday communities can help nature and wildlife all over the UK. And you can share your story here too!
