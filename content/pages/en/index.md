## This website will help you to help nature.

Please explore our website. You can choose Welsh by clicking the button at the top. If you want to get in touch, please email us on [nextdoornature@wildlifetrust.org](mailto:nextdoornature@wildlifetrust.org). We’d love to hear from you!

## Here, you will find GUIDES and STORIES. Guides are full of simple, easy-to-understand information in words and videos to help you to take action for nature.

Nextdoor Nature is a project from The Wildlife Trusts. We’re working with communities to bring people together and give everyone the power to help nature flourish – everywhere.

## Stories are where you can read all about what other people are doing where they live and work. They are full of ideas to show you how everyday communities can help nature and wildlife all over the UK. And you can share your story here too!

Thanks to £5million funding from The National Lottery Heritage Fund, Nextdoor Nature provides you with the advice and support you need to help nature on your doorstep, and leave a lasting natural legacy to mark The Queen’s Platinum Jubilee.
