## Who we are and what we do

#### N﻿extdoor Nature is a project from The Wildlife Trusts

We’re working with communities to bring people together and give everyone the power to help nature flourish – everywhere.

W﻿hat does this actually mean? Well, this is about supporting local people - people like you. We work alongside you, and help you work out what you really want to do in your area. How can you make it a better place to live and work? How can you help nature and wildlife? We don't know what you want or need - so we work with you to find out.

W﻿hen you know what you want to do, we show you how to get started. But we don't tell you what to do. We don't start projects or lead sessions. It's your community, your area, and your project. We can link you up with other groups, we can give you advice and help, and we can show you where to start. But it's important that you take the lead, so that the project can go on and on, and grow even more without us!

Thanks to £5million funding from The National Lottery Heritage Fund, Nextdoor Nature provides you with the advice and support you need to help nature on your doorstep, and leave a lasting natural legacy to mark The Queen’s Platinum Jubilee.

#### T﻿he Wildlife Trusts

The Wildlife Trusts are a grassroots movement of people from a wide range of backgrounds and all walks of life, who believe that we need nature and nature needs us. We have more than 900,000 members, over 35,000 volunteers, 2,000 staff and 600 trustees. There are 46 individual Wildlife Trusts, each of which is a place-based independent charity with its own legal identity, formed by groups of people getting together and working with others to make a positive difference to wildlife and future generations, starting where they live and work.

Every Wildlife Trust is part of The Wildlife Trusts federation and a corporate member of the Royal Society of Wildlife Trusts, a registered charity in its own right [founded in 1912](https://www.wildlifetrusts.org/about-us/our-history) and one of the founding members of IUCN – the International Union for the Conservation of Nature. Taken together this federation of 47 charities is known as The Wildlife Trusts.
