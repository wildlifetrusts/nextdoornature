This site has two main parts. **Guides** are full of quick, easy information for everyone. They are written in English and Welsh and most of them also have a video if you prefer to watch and listen.

**Stories** are all about you! Anyone can send us a story about a community project. Find other stories that inspire you, and connect with groups in your area. You can submit your story [here](/submit-story).
