## Privacy Policy

_Please note: Our privacy policy is updated periodically, and it is advised that you check back for updates regularly. Any changes will replace all previous versions and will be in force from the date of publication.  
Last updated: March 2023_

### 1. Who are we?

The Wildlife Trusts are a movement of more than 800,000 members, 40,000 volunteers, 2,000 staff and 600 trustees, from a wide range of backgrounds and all walks of life.

For more than a century, we have been saving, protecting and standing up for wildlife and wild places, increasing people's awareness and understanding of the natural world, and deepening people's relationship with it.

Our roots are local. Each Wildlife Trust has been formed by groups of active and motivated people getting together to make a difference where they live and work.

We look after more than 2,300 nature reserves, covering 98,500 hectares, and operate more than 100 visitor and education centres in every part of the UK, on the Isles of Alderney and Man.

We work on land and sea, from mountain tops to the seabed, from the remotest wilderness to city streets. Wherever you are, our people, places and projects are never far away.

We work productively with more than 1,800 companies, with other environmental organisations, community groups, local authorities, national governments, schools, universities, lotteries, charitable trusts and foundations, fishermen, divers, farmers, landowners, politicians from across the political spectrum, and more.

There are 37 individual Trusts covering England, five in Wales and single Trusts covering each of Scotland, Northern Ireland and two Crown Dependencies. Wherever we work, we are accountable to people who live nearby.

The Trusts are supported in doing this by the central charity, RSWT (the Royal Society of Wildlife Trusts), the purpose of which is “to lead the movement's development, to build trust and to represent the interests of the movement whenever a strong united voice is required”.

This policy applies to your interactions with the central charity, each Wildlife Trust has its own privacy policy (for further details, please visit the website of the Trust concerned).

### 2. Our commitment to your privacy

We are committed to keeping your personal details safe. This policy explains how and why we use your personal data, to ensure that you remain informed and in control of your information.

Any references to the Royal Society of Wildlife Trusts, or to 'we' or 'us' refer to:

- The Royal Society of Wildlife Trusts. We are a registered charity in England and Wales, and our registered charity number is 207238.
- Wildlife Trust Services Limited, our charitable trading company; (registered company number 02540956). The company is a wholly owned subsidiary of Royal Society of Wildlife Trusts, which trades only to raise funds for our charitable organisation.
  We use three key definitions to describe people mentioned in this policy. These are definitions enshrined in GDPR and used by the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), the UK's independent body set up to uphold information rights [www.ico.org.uk](https://ico.org.uk/)

- 'Data subject': this is you. As the data subject, we respect your right to control your data.
- 'Data controller': this is us, the Royal Society of Wildlife Trusts. We determine why and how your personal data is used (as outlined in this policy).

- 'Data processor': this is an organisation that processes data on behalf of RSWT or at RSWT's discretion. RSWT takes full responsibility for what they do.

When we work with other organisations or individuals in this way, we always set up a written contract with them to protect your data. The third parties we work with at no point 'own' your data, so you will never hear from them independently and they will always delete your data from their systems when they have completed the task in hand. We always send your data to partner organisations securely, to minimise the risk of it being intercepted by unknown individuals and/or organisations.

We will never sell your personal data.

Should you wish to find out more about the information we hold about you, or about our privacy policy, please contact us:

Our office hours are Monday – Friday, 9am – 5pm.

### 3. Why do we collect your personal data?

We use your personal data to keep in touch with you.

We will only ever collect, store and use your personal data when we have an identified purpose and reason to do so. The ICO refers to this as a 'lawful basis'. Further information about why we collect your personal data is outlined below.

#### a) To administer your donations

We collect your personal data to administer your donations, which may involve:

- Sending you a thank you letter or email
- Getting in touch should there ever be any issues processing your donation

The lawful basis for processing your data for these purposes may be 'contractual' or 'legitimate interest'.

#### b) To send you items purchased from our online shop

We collect your personal data to send you:

- items you have purchased from our online shop

The lawful basis for processing your data for these purposes is 'contractual'.

#### c) To send you information about our work

We also collect your personal data so that we can send you information about our work that we feel will be of interest to you, this includes your Natural World magazine, fundraising appeals, campaigning opportunities, Wildlife Watch and other activities.

This information is in addition to that outlined in sections a) and b) and is interpreted as 'direct marketing' by the ICO.

Your personal data also helps us to get to know you better and to develop a 'profile' of you on our secure supporter database. This 'profile' enables us to send you the information listed above in a timely and relevant way, to suit you. For example, keeping track of the donations you make to our organisation helps us to send you information about fundraising appeals that we feel you would like to hear about.

We also use your data to analyse and refine our campaigning, advertising and other operations to increase our effectiveness and allow us to refine our audiences to make sure the ads you're seeing are relevant to you, this process could include uploading data to various advertising platforms that the Wildlife Trusts uses.

We may use your data on when using social media advertising platform advertising tools, to further ensure that our advertising campaigns are as effective as possible, by making sure both our budget is used effectively and the ads that you see are relevant to you. This means we can target based on specific characteristics and interests. We collect the data from campaigns, adverts, posts and interactions with our website and social platforms.

We use two different lawful bases for processing your data for 'direct marketing' purposes:

##### i) Legitimate interest

This is where we have identified a genuine and legitimate reason (see section 3c) for contacting you, which crucially does not override your rights or interests

We use legitimate interest to send you the information listed above by post or telephone (if you are not registered with the Telephone Preference Service, and you have given us your telephone number).

##### ii) Opt-in consent

This is where you have given us express permission to contact you by particular communication channels.

We use opt-in consent to send you the information listed above by email, text message (SMS) or telephone (if you are registered with the Telephone Preference Service)

We respect your right to update the way we get in touch with you about our work at any time.

#### d) To enable you to volunteer with us

If you are a Royal Society of Wildlife Trusts volunteer, we collect your personal data so that we can keep in touch with you about, for example:

- changes to planned volunteer work programmes that you may be taking part in
- the positive impact you have on our work

#### e) If you have made a general enquiry, which we think is better handled by a local Trust, we will pass this enquiry on

The lawful basis for processing your data for these purposes may be 'contractual' and 'legitimate interest' (when sending you information about our work).

### 4. What kind of personal data do we collect? How do we collect it?

#### a) Basic information

We will usually collect basic information about you, including your name, postal address, telephone number, email address and your bank details if you are supporting us financially.

Most of the time, we collect this data from you directly. Sometimes this is in person; other times, it is over the telephone, in writing or through an email. Occasionally we obtain information, such as your telephone number or other contact details, from external sources (only where you have given permission for such information to be shared).

#### b) Getting to know you better

We also collect information about you that helps us to get to know you better. This may include:

- records of donations you've made
- your preferences of how you would like us to contact you
- ways you've helped us through volunteering your time
- records of events you've attended, or campaigns or activities that you've been involved in

Sometimes we will collect other information about you such as your date of birth and gender. When we do so, we will be very clear as to why we are collecting such information, and we will only do so with your specific consent and permission.

Once again, most of the time we collect this data from you directly.

We may also collect demographic and consumption data generated through geodemographic tools (such as CACI Acorn), as well as information related to your wealth. This may include information from public registers and other publicly available sources such as Companies House, newspapers and magazines. If you do not wish your data to be collected in any of these ways, or have questions about them, please contact us.

Telephone: 01636 677711 \
Email: [enquiries@wildlifetrusts.org](mailto:enquiries@wildlifetrusts.org) \
The Kiln, Mather Road, Newark, NG24 1WT

Our office hours are Monday – Friday, 9am – 5pm.

Other ways in which we collect personal data to get to know you better include:

##### i) Our website

#### c) Sensitive personal data

We do not normally collect or store sensitive personal data, also known as special category data, (such as information relating to health, beliefs or political affiliation) about supporters. However, there are some situations where this will occur.

When we do so, we will be very clear as to why we are collecting such information. In most cases we will only collect such information with your specific consent and permission. In these situations, we collect the data from you directly. There are limited cases where permission is not required for processing special category data.

If you are a volunteer then we may collect extra information about you, for example:

- references
- criminal records checks
- details of emergency contacts
- medical conditions

We may also collect sensitive personal data in case of an accident on our premises. This information will be retained for legal reasons, for safeguarding purposes and to protect us (including in the event of an insurance or legal claim). If this does occur, we'll take extra care to ensure your privacy rights are protected.

#### d) Children and young people

In line with data protection law, if we receive any information through any data collection channel that indicates an individual is under 13 years old age, we will not store or process that individual's personal details, unless we have the express permission from your parent or guardian to do so.

### 5. How do we store your data?

#### a) Security

All of the personal data we process is processed by our staff in the UK. However, for the purposes of IT hosting and maintenance your information may be situated outside of the European Economic Area (EEA). This will be done in accordance with guidance issued by the Information Commissioner's Office.

Electronic data and databases are stored on secure computer systems and we control who has access to information (using both physical and electronic means). Our staff receive data protection training and we have a set of detailed data protection procedures which personnel are required to follow when handling personal data.

#### b) Payment security

All electronic Royal Society of Wildlife Trusts forms that request financial data will use the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol to encrypt the data between your browser and our servers.

If you use a credit card to donate, purchase a membership or purchase something online we will pass your credit card details securely to our payment provider (Stripe; PayPal). Other payment methods (e.g. ApplePay) are handled in a similar manner.

The Royal Society of Wildlife Trusts complies with the payment card industry data security standard (PCI-DSS) published by the PCI Security Standards Council, and will never store card details.

Of course, we cannot guarantee the security of your home computer or the internet, and any online communications (e.g. information provided by email or our website) are at the user's own risk.

#### c) Data retention policy

We will only use and store information for as long as it is required for the purposes it was collected for. We continually review what information we hold, and delete what is no longer required.

We would also like to state that only those who have authorisation within The Wildlife Trusts have access to your personal data and all staff are trained in data protection and are compliant in making sure that this is used in the correct manner. Those who have access to personal data will only do so for the necessary tasks and will make sure to handle this data in the safest way possible. We will never use your data for anything other than what is stated within our privacy policy.

#### a) The right to be informed

### 7. Making a complaint

The Royal Society of Wildlife Trusts want to exceed your expectation in everything we do. However, we know that there may be times when we do not meet our own high standards. When this happens, we want to hear about it, in order to deal with the situation as quickly as possible and put measures in place to stop it happening again.

We take complaints very seriously and we treat them as an opportunity to develop our approach. This is why we are always very grateful to hear from people who are willing to take the time to help us improve.

Our policy is:

- To provide a fair complaints procedure that is clear and easy to use for anyone wishing to make a complaint.
- To publicise the existence of our complaints procedure so that people know how to contact us to make a complaint.
- To make sure everyone in our organisation knows what to do if a complaint is received.
- To make sure all complaints are investigated fairly and in a timely way.
- To make sure that complaints are, wherever possible, resolved and that relationships are repaired.
- To learn from complaints and feedback to help us to improve what we do.

#### Confidentiality

All complaint information will be handled sensitively, in line with relevant data protection requirements.

#### Responsibility

Overall responsibility for this policy and its implementation lies with the Director of Marketing and Development

Occasionally, where we partner with other organisations, we may also share information with them (for example our Wild About Gardens campaign which is a partnership campaign with The RHS).
