## 1﻿. Change what you eat.

F﻿arming created 11 per cent of UK greenhouse gas emissions in 2020. But if you buy from local shops and farms, eat more plant-based foods, and choose food that is grown in season, you can make a difference. Why not check out our [Coronation Gardens project here](https://mycoronationgarden.org/) for more help in getting started?

## 2﻿. Change how you travel.

T﻿ransport creates 34 per cent of all UK greenhouse gas emissions. Think about how you could walk or cycle, or take buses and trains instead. [Find more hints and tips here.](https://www.wildlifetrusts.org/actions/change-how-you-travel)

## 3﻿. Change your energy use.

T﻿he energy used in buildings creates around 17 per cent of total UK emissions. Switch to a renewable energy supplier or find out more about heat pumps. [There is more help here.](https://www.wildlifetrusts.org/actions/change-your-energy-use)

## 4﻿. Recycle and reuse.

## 5﻿. Reduce your flood risk.

1﻿.9 million people in the UK live in areas that are at risk of bad flooding. And this could double by the 2050s. Avoid paving over your garden; choose grass and plants instead. [For more help, click here.](https://www.wildlifetrusts.org/actions/climate-friendly-gardening#flood)

## 6﻿. Reduce your heat risk.

A﻿round 20 per cent of homes are at risk of overheating. Shading your windows, and planting more greenery around your house, can help to lower temperatures. [More ideas are here.](https://www.wildlifetrusts.org/actions/climate-friendly-gardening#heat)

## 7﻿. Reduce your water use.

T﻿he average person uses about 140 litres of water a day, and we know that we're facing huge water problems in the future. You can help by using water butts in your garden, fitting a water meter, and making sure you buy water-efficient appliances.

## 8﻿. Contact your MP.

Y﻿our MP works for you - and they need your vote. Make sure they know how you feel about nature and the climate crisis. Use our related guides to find your local MP and also see our guide on how to speak with confidence to people in authority.
