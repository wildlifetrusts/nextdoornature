## General advice about funding

There are many small and large sources of funding across the UK.

But first you need to know exactly what you want to do. Many funders will only work with certain projects, like the arts, or young people, and so on.

You also need to know how much money you are asking for. Funders often have restrictions on how much they’ll give.

You’ll need to have a bank account for the group. You won’t always need to be a charity.
[Groundwork](https://www.groundwork.org.uk/project-fundraising-tips/) has some excellent and simple advice about applying for funding. We also have our own advice in a separate document.

To find out about specific funding from your local council, in England and Wales, use the government’s funding finder. Click [this link](https://www.gov.uk/apply-funding-community-project) and put your postcode in the box. It will take you to the right page on your local council’s website.

Sign up for the free account at [My Funding Central.](https://www.myfundingcentral.co.uk/) They’ll email you regularly with funding news.

The website [Community Foundations](https://www.ukcommunityfoundations.org/our-network) covers most of the UK. Put your postcode in, and it’ll find your nearest Community Foundation. These are groups which help small organisations to find money.

## Lists of funders

If you prefer to look at a book, you can use *The Directory of Grant Making Trusts*. It’s published every year by The Directory of Social Change, and it’ll usually be in your local library.

[Grants Online](https://www.grantsonline.org.uk/news/community-development/) lists new grants available across the UK. The list updates every day.

[GrantFinder](https://www.grantfinder.co.uk/funding-highlights/funds/community-development/) also lists funding across the UK. That link goes to their community development grants, but also look at other sections. These might be:

* Arts, Culture and Heritage Funding.
* Environmental Grants, Grants for Children.
* Young People and Families.
* …and maybe some of the others, depending on how specialist your project is.

[Charity Excellence](https://www.charityexcellence.co.uk/Home/BlogDetail?Link=Small_Charity_NonProfit_Grant_Funding) has a free Funder Finding Database.

Here is the [National Lottery Community Fund.](https://www.tnlcommunityfund.org.uk/funding/thinking-of-applying-for-funding) 

This is some specifically [Scottish funding.](https://www.communityfoodandhealth.org.uk/funding/funding-sources/)

## Other sources of money

It’s unlikely you’ll be looking for investment rather than a grant. But if you do want to borrow money, look [here.](https://locality.org.uk/services-tools/funding/) 

You might do some fundraising activities. Look at our separate document about running fundraising events.

## Other help

[NCVO has a free spreadsheet tool](https://www.ncvo.org.uk/help-and-guidance/running-a-charity/financial-management/planning-and-budgeting/funding-and-income-planner/) to help you plan your budget. This can be useful when you’re applying for grants!
