This advice is for you if you are planning a one-off event to raise money. If you want to apply for funding, see our other resources.


There are many different events you can do to raise money. There are no specific rules around things like Charity Cake/Bake Sales. However, food hygiene is very important, and you can find easy-to-read information on the Food Standards website [here.]
(https://www.food.gov.uk/business-guidance/food-hygiene-for-your-business) Remember to think about food allergies and label any food if it has nuts or other things that could make some people ill.


As well as cake sales, cake parties, community picnics and coffee mornings, there are lots of other things you could do. Here are some ideas to bring people together:



* Car wash
* Open gardens day
* Walk for wildlife
* Talent show
* Games tournament
* Quiz night
* Raffle
* Night walk
* Bingo
* Dress up
* Dawn chorus walk
* Wild sleepover



You can sell things:

* Book sale
* Art and craft sale
* Bring and buy sale
* Auction



People can get sponsored to do things like:

* Shave your hair
* Sponsored silence
* Give something up, like a bad habit



Or you can get active! Try these:

* Assault course
* Skydive
* Run a marathon
* Mini-Olympics
* Abseiling
* Fun run
* Football match
* Barn dance
* Bike ride



## Planning the event:

**Where will the event happen?** If it is outside, you need to check the weather forecast and have a plan in case the weather’s too bad. If the event is on private land, you’ll need the landowner’s permission. If the event is on public land, contact your local council first – before you do any publicity!


**You must do a risk assessment.** The risk assessment will tell you if you need insurance. Find out more about risk assessments and insurance in our other resources.


**When will the event happen?** Who’s invited? Set a fundraising goal.


**You need to promote the event.** You can create posters and leaflets. See more guidance about posters and leaflets in our other resources.


**You can promote the event online.** You could see up a JustGiving Page or other online fundraising page and you can use social media too. Remember to tell your local Wildlife Trust what you’re doing! And let the local papers and radio stations know. You can find a template for a press release in our other resources.


**Don’t try to do everything yourself!** People love to be helpful. Ask people what they’d like to do and draw up a plan together. Even a small event can be a lot of work. On the day itself, don’t forget to plan breaks for everyone – and that includes you! Take lots of photos and of course, have fun.


**Afterwards,** add up how much you raised, and be sure to let everyone know.
