## [cCc] Types of Community Group (England and Wales)

### An Unincorporated Association

If you’re just a small group of volunteers, with no plans to employ staff or rent premises, this is the one
for you.

It’s the easiest group to set up. All you need is to write a “constitution” or “governing document”. This
is a list of rules for the group. It also says what your group’s going to do, and how it’s going to do it.

#### This kind of group:

- doesn’t have to be a charity (although you can set up a charity if you want to). You will need to get official advice if you want to be a charity.
- isn’t a separate legal structure. This means the group can’t take on a contract or own property - but individual members can do.
- has members who vote on what the group should do.
- the group can become a different type of group or a charity later.
  See our separate document about “Setting up a Community Group” for information about unincorporated associations.

### Incorporated and Unincorporated

The difference between these two things is just whether your group has a separate “legal personality” of its own. An incorporated group can employ people, take on a contract or rent property. If there’s any debt, that debt belongs to the group not the people running the group. This means an incorporated group is more regulated than an unincorporated one. You’ll probably need help from accountants and solicitors.

#### Examples of incorporated groups:

- Community Interest Company (CIC)
- Company Limited by Guarantee
- Charitable Incorporated Organisation
- Community Benefit Society
- Cooperative Society
