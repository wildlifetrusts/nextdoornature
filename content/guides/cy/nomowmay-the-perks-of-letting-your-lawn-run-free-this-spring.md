Before you reach for the lawnmower this spring, consider letting your grass grow longer throughout May.  

Why, you ask? Because allowing your lawn to grow a little wild and unkempt during this time of year can work wonders for backyard biodiversity and wildlife.  

This is all part of the #NoMowMay movement. A simple concept, it calls on households to avoid mowing for the entire month and allow the grass, flowers and other plants to shoot up. In doing so, you're providing a much-needed early-season feast and habitat for [bees](https://www.wildlifetrusts.org/actions/how-attract-bumblebees-your-garden), [butterflies](https://www.wildlifetrusts.org/actions/how-attract-butterflies-your-garden) and other important pollinators.  

### The benefits of long grass

A new [UK study](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/apr/19/letting-grass-grow-long-boosts-butterfly-numbers-uk-study-proves) has revealed just how impactful this lazy gardening approach can be. Analysing butterfly sightings across 600 gardens over 6 years, researchers found that yards with long grass had up to 93% more butterflies fluttering around and a greater variety of species.  

The long grass creates breeding territory and food sources that attract species like meadow browns, gatekeepers and ringlets whose caterpillar offspring munch on grasses and wildflowers. 

And it’s not just butterflies that thrive when you skip the mow. Common flowers like dandelions, clovers and daisies popping up are crucial for hungry pollinators like bees.  

One survey from the charity, [Garden Organic](https://www.gardenorganic.org.uk/expert-advice/garden-management/wildlife-gardening/no-mow-may?gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAjwoPOwBhAeEiwAJuXRh9uuqOj3hxzyeh6gqpFxLA4YPVPnTNgPFgdlb06yDOz9tjeOwkxTrBoC-iwQAvD_BwE), found that an average unmown lawn can produce a massive 23kg of nectar sugar daily - enough to support over 2 million honeybees.  

When May comes to an end, you can go back to mowing as and when you need to. A monthly trim will keep things tidy while also supporting biodiversity. To make the biggest impact, try leaving a few patches of grass completely wild for the entire summer.  

### Go a step further and plant a wildflower meadow

If you want to go the extra mile for nature, consider growing your lawn into a wildlife-friendly meadow, rich in wildflowers.  

There are several factors to consider before planting a wildflower meadow if you want the best chance of success. 

* First, get to know your soil. Most wildflowers prefer nutrient-poor soil with low fertility. This helps them compete against plants and other “problem plants” like nettle, thistle and dock. Head to [this resource by Plantlife](https://meadows.plantlife.org.uk/making-meadows/principles-of-meadow-making/soil/) to learn how to check your soil.  
* You will also want to look at the plants you already have on your lawn. If you can spot more than four wildflower species, you may just need to sit back and let your meadow restore itself naturally.  
* To do this, you will need to put away the mower for the entirety of spring and summer. You can clear patches of grass if you want to create a path or small play area, but the majority of your grass should be kept long until the flowers have set seeds.  
* At this point, fire up the mower, cut the lawn down to a few inches and remove the clippings. You can leave patches of longer grass to house invertebrates, but the majority should be kept at ankle height throughout the winter months.  

If your lawn is lacking in plant diversity, you may need to start from scratch. This process starts in late summer or Autumn. Read all about creating a new wildflower meadow in this handy [PDF guide from Plantlife](https://www.plantlife.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/How_to_make_a_meadow_with_native_wildflowers.pdf).  

If you do decide to sow seeds, it is always best to plant species that are native to your area. This provides the best possible habitat for local insects and birds.  

Your local Wildlife Trust or other conservation organisations may be able to advise you on the best plants to sow in your area or refer to online resources like this comprehensive article from Plantlife on the [principles of meadow making](https://meadows.plantlife.org.uk/making-meadows/principles-of-meadow-making/).  

If you’re thinking about planting wildflowers somewhere other than your garden, be sure to read our [guide to growing wild plants here](https://nextdoornaturehub.org.uk/guides/the-importance-of-local-species).  

### Why do we love lawns so much, anyway?

The concept of a neatly kept grass lawn can be traced back to the early 18th century. At this time, grass was a vital source of food for grazing livestock, so employing skilled labourers to cut and dispose of such a valuable resource was a luxury reserved only for the elite.  

As a result, a well-maintained lawn became something of a status symbol. This meant that when the mechanical lawn mower was invented in 1830, the middle classes were eager to replicate the aristocrats’ pristine gardens on their own land.    

By the 20th century, the grass lawn had become one of the most prominent landscape features in gardens across the country.  

Sadly, this trend in garden management was detrimental to wildlife. Regular mowing prevented other plants like wildflowers from growing and the resulting decline in insect and invertebrate populations meant less food for animals like birds, frogs and hedgehogs.  

Thankfully, it doesn’t take much to start bringing wildlife back to your garden. In fact, the lazier you are with your lawn the better! Just let your lawn grow free and start looking out for the return of nature to your back garden.
