'Composting' is a natural process that takes bits of vegetables or plants, plus paper and cardboard, and lets it rot down to become compost – which is lovely stuff that can help make your soil better. Everything decays naturally anyway, but composting uses tricks and tips to make it happen faster. 

## Why do you need compost?

Over time, growing things will take some of the nutrients out of soil. Compost is like a snack for your garden, giving it a boost of energy. 

Making your own compost is also a great way to reduce how much rubbish you send to landfill. 

And it makes a great habitat for a wide range of wildlife in your garden, too! Slugs and snails are vital to a working compost heap because they help to munch their way through the decaying matter and they speed the process up. Then those slugs and snails become food for garden visitors like birds and hedgehogs, attracting more wildlife to your garden.

In fact, this year, our Wild About Gardens campaign in association with the RHS is all about celebrating these unsung heroes! There are many different types and most of them aren't interested in your lettuces at all. They're vital for making good compost, for cleaning up decaying matter, and they make tasty snacks for birds and other wildlife too.

## Do I need a compost bin?

You don’t need any special equipment. You can often buy compost bins cheaply through your local council, but these aren’t essential. You will need to cover your compost but you can use a sheet of plastic, or some old carpet.  

Many people build simple bins from old pallets or wood. Garden Organic show you how to make a [wooden compost bin here,](https://www.gardenorganic.org.uk/expert-advice/garden-management/composting/homemade-compost-bins) and Ben from GrowVeg has a [handy video here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW_DVNUt7ms) Make sure you don’t use pallets marked with MB – they have been treated with a highly toxic compound. Although they were phased out in the UK in 2010, they can sometimes still be found. Choose ones with HT – heat treated – instead. 

Put the compost heap or bin in a shady spot, so it doesn’t dry out in hot weather. It’s also useful to have it near a path and not too far from your back door so that you remember to use it – but not too close, either! 

Don’t cut off all the air to the compost heap. You may need to turn or stir it from time to time, usually every three months. But watch out – in winter, you might disturb hibernating wildlife. 

## How do I make compost?

We have a great guide on [The Wildlife Trusts webpage here.](https://www.wildlifetrusts.org/actions/how-compost-your-waste) 

You need a good mix of ‘greens’ and ‘browns’. You can add grass cuttings, leaves, vegetable scraps, old cut flowers, stuff you have pruned, old coffee grounds, washed eggshells, and shredded newspaper. 

Be careful with cardboard – you can add cardboard that you’ve torn up, but make sure it’s not glossy or coated. 

You can add teabags if the box says they are plastic-free. 

If you have pets that eat vegetables, like gerbils or rabbits, you can add their droppings and their bedding if it’s made from natural materials like straw or paper. 

You can’t add cooked food, including meat and fish; cat, dog or human poo; or ash from a coal fire although wood ash from a logburner can be okay in small amounts.  

You should generally avoid anything with woody stems, and don’t add perennial weeds or invasive species. While a very hot compost bin can theoretically break down weed seeds, most home compost heaps don’t get hot enough.

## I don’t have enough space for any of this!

Don’t worry – there are other options. 

Bokashi bins are popular in Japan and Korea, where many people live in flats with no outside space. They consist of one or more plastic tubs with a tap at the bottom. You add in your kitchen scraps, and each time you do, you scatter some special bran on it. Over time, the microbes in the bran break down the kitchen scraps. It also produces rich liquid that you draw off with the tap which you can use to fertilise your houseplants.  

Many communities now have community composting areas, especially in community growing spaces and on allotments. Incredible Edible is a great place to start; [find out more here.](https://www.incredibleedible.org.uk/)
